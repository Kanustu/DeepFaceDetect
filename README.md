# DeepFaceGuard
 - An attempt at Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) deepfake detection with facial images.

## Project Outcomes
In this capstone project, my goal is to achieve deepfake image detection using multiple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) models within an ensemble method. The project involves the following key steps: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), image processing, model creation, and model deployment.

## Project Description

In this project, our approach involves employing a variety of CNN models with the primary objective of creating an ensemble method capable of distinguishing between authentic images (real) and those generated using deepfake technology, focusing specifically on Nvidia's StyleGAN: https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan.
